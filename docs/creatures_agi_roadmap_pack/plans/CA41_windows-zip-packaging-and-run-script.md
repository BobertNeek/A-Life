# CA41 - Windows zip packaging and run script

## Phase
J

## Mode
Full Spec Loop

## Review class
R2

## Objective
Produce a runnable Windows alpha package without requiring manual cargo commands.

## Dependencies
CAR40

## Owned scope
scripts/tools/docs.

## Required work
- Release build script.
- Copy assets/configs/shaders.
- Run script.
- Version/commit metadata.
- No tag unless approved.

## Forbidden scope
- Do not create S12/G25/P37. Do not tag a release. Do not weaken validation. Do not commit screenshots/logs/target artifacts. Do not leak Bevy/wgpu/GPU deps into alife_core. Do not claim full action-authoritative GPU runtime unless this exact plan owns and proves that claim.


## Required tests and evidence
- Add or update tests for the user-visible behavior touched by this plan.
- Preserve existing smoke tests.
- Record focused evidence in docs if this plan changes product behavior.

## Focused commands
- Use relevant existing smoke commands for this plan.
- If this plan changes graphical behavior, run graphical smoke and forced fallback.
- If this plan changes GPU behavior, run GPU runtime/timing commands where supported.

## Validation
Run full validation from VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md. Also run plan-specific focused commands. Use Windows wrappers; never plain bash.

## Review checklist
- Scope matches this plan only.
- No forbidden new plan or release tag.
- No tracked artifacts.
- `alife_core` dependency tree is clean.
- Player-facing claims match evidence.
- GPU/CPU claims are honest.
- Tests cover the new behavior.
- Documentation updated when behavior or commands changed.
