# N2048 training operator

Use PowerShell 7 from the authoritative repository root. The guarded launcher prepares a **fidelity pilot**, not a training campaign. A separate training-only CLI now runs a bounded real-world cohort cycle; it has not passed the behavioral gates for an overnight campaign.

```powershell
Set-Location -LiteralPath 'D:\A life'
& 'C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe' -NoProfile -File .\scripts\run_n2048_care_training.ps1 -Mode Status
& 'C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe' -NoProfile -File .\scripts\run_n2048_care_training.ps1 -Mode Prepare
```

Before `Prepare`, the supervisor must release the Cargo/GPU lane. Do not run another Cargo command, game, GPU test, or training process alongside it. The launcher takes an exclusive file lock and rejects existing project processes; that lock only coordinates callers that respect it. It never kills processes.

Preparation builds `train_n2048_care` with `foundation-training`, runs exact serial gates (including the PPO GPU objective and selective merge), requires one executed passing test per gate, and runs the supported `--pilot` command for a fixed 32 ticks. Cargo uses existing default features and dependencies offline, two build jobs, and the development profile. This is correctness evidence, not a release-performance measurement. No source edits, downloads, legacy trainer fallback, or full test suites are performed.

Evidence lives in a fresh `target/founder-training/prepare-*` directory. `source/` records HEAD, the complete tracked binary diff, and hashes of nonignored new files under source/docs/scripts/assets directories. Artifact folders, Blender backups, and Python caches are excluded. Source identity is checked between phases and after the pilot. Each command has separate stdout/stderr logs. `status.json` is atomically published both in that directory and at `target/founder-training/status.json`.

`Prepared` means the listed gates and pilot succeeded for that exact source, executable, and receipt. The executable enforces replay tolerances; the launcher additionally rejects missing, negative, or nonfinite receipt metrics. Matching successful evidence is reused. `Failed` means stop and inspect the named phase and logs with the supervisor. Do not change tolerances, skip a gate, repeatedly retry, delete receipts, or modify source just to change its fingerprint. An interrupted `Running` receipt also needs supervisor diagnosis. Check status with the first command above.

`-Mode Campaign` deliberately fails. The CLI can run a single cohort and resume its actor/value optimizer state in another bounded cohort. For a focused operator check, choose fresh output directories and run:

```powershell
cargo run -p alife_game_app --features foundation-training --bin train_n2048_care -- --cycle target/founder-training/cycle-001 4
target/debug/train_n2048_care.exe --resume-cycle target/founder-training/cycle-001 target/founder-training/cycle-002 4
```

The cycle collects ordinary GPU decisions, streams Zstd-compressed binary replay records with a 4 GiB disk ceiling and 8 GiB process-memory check, predicts frozen values, calculates GAE across natural sleep gaps using actual world time, applies PPO in 256-tick waking windows with up to 128 burn-in ticks, exports a canonical N2048 asset, and verifies its admission into a fresh cohort. Structural synapses remain frozen replay context while inherited weights train. The first waking decision after each sleep must pass exact GPU production/replay parity. The sealed experience patch retains its existing JSON wire inside each binary record. The second command restores the exported actor, Adam state, and GPU value head, and increments the policy version. Both commands fail rather than overwrite an output directory. `cycle.json` and its actor/value checkpoints are integration evidence, not a full campaign checkpoint or a promoted founder. The cycle accepts at most 36,000 waking decisions and fails if the organism dies; this limit has not been verified as a 30-minute life.

Do not start an overnight campaign yet. Grounded demonstrations, protected behavioral development/acceptance panels, long-life biological survival, measured throughput, and a durable deadline/best-checkpoint coordinator remain unimplemented. A 640-decision optimized cycle crossed five natural sleep gaps and updated actor and critic; a separate 400-decision cycle passed exact replay parity after structural growth. These are integration evidence, not a measured 10–30-minute life or campaign. The current development plan is [the training regimen](n2048-care-training-regimen-2026-09-21.md).
