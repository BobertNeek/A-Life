## Global constraints inherited from P01-P36

- Do not create P37. This is the `Gxx` playable-sim product phase.
- Keep `alife_core` engine-independent. No Bevy, Avian, wgpu, renderer, ECS, OS-windowing, Python runtime objects, Unity, C#, or HLSL production dependencies in core.
- Headless CPU remains the correctness oracle and default CI path.
- Bevy/Avian, GPU, semantic/SLM, school UI, and research tooling remain optional or feature-gated unless a plan explicitly hardens them.
- Preserve P09 structured action arbitration. No direct motor bypass from memory, topology, teacher, semantic provider, UI, or debug tools.
- Preserve sealed three-phase `ExperiencePatch` before learning, memory, topology, logging, or school verification.
- Preserve P34 stable-ID save/load policy. Do not persist Bevy `Entity`, Avian handles, wgpu handles, renderer handles, or OS window handles.
- Do not claim GPU performance without measured hardware evidence. CPU fallback reports are not GPU timing claims.
- Do not commit large logs, generated tensors, GPU captures, or benchmark artifacts.
- Do not weaken existing P36 release gates or golden trace policy.
